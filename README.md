## General Information
- A Consumer Finance Company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
   - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
   - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

- The purpose of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset. The EDA includes the data cleanup and removal of unwanted data which is not required in our analysis work. 
- With the help of Data Analysis, we are trying to find out main driving factors behind the default loans.
- The dataset that has been used in this project is the loan data which includes around 40k loans issued during the period of 2007 to 2011.

## Conclusions
### After performing all the analysis on the dataset. We have reached to the following Conclusions:
- It is observed that the ratio of Charged Off higher where annual income is under 20k. Loans should be avoided to applicants with lower income.
- Small Business applicants have high chances of getting default. Loans should be given carefully to Small Businessnes.
- Although most applicants have a loan term of 36 months, but the ratio of 60 months term is much higher on Charged Off loans. The company should give more loans with a shorter term. Short term loans will have lower interest rates than long term and applicants will be able to pay the instalments on time.
- There are high chances of getting Charged Off if applicant has a previous Derogatory Public Record or Public Bankruptcy.
